## September 10th - September 16th

**Group Number**: 19
**Group Advisor**: Suraj C. Kothari
**Client**: Suraj C. Kothari

## Accomplishments This Week

* Had the first meeting between our design team, Professor Kothari, and team.
    * Discussed what his team had done so far, what we need to do to catch up, and a few ideas he had for us in terms of project definitions.
    * Watched a demo of the Hello World program used to detect malware.
* Went through the Hello World demo on our own.
* Created GitHub accounts.
* Thought about how we want to define this project and its deliverables to be discussed with Professor Kothari at the next meeting.

## Next Week's Plan

* Become familiar with the Android program structure if we haven't had experience in it.
* Install JAtlas or the prebundled version with Eclipse on our machine.
* Define the project and its deliverables.

## Issues

* The project still does not have a firm definition since Professor Kothari thinks we'd be better off defining a project apart from the one he already has going that is analyzing malware. This should be resolved by the next meeting though.
