## January 21st - January 28th

**Group Number**: 19  
**Group Advisor**: Suraj C. Kothari  
**Client**: Suraj C. Kothari  

### Accomplishments This Week

* Established weekly meeting time for both internal team as well as meetings with client/advisor
* Created a private GitHub repository for our custom toolbox
* Started moving our small demo program to the new toolbox
* Started exploring the Eclipse Plugin SDK
* Experimented with J-Atlas and the handling of Annotations
* Began creating a more extensive testing application that tests other types of checkers other than just nullness

### Next Week's Plan

* Meet as a group to prepare for Kothari meeting
* Meet for the first time this semester with Kothari
* Begin more extensive coding on the Eclipse Plugin
* Start to abstract out the small demo program from last semester into an algorithm that compares types other than a hard coded Null checker

### Issues

* Finding at least 2 meeting times that work for everybody (should be worked out now)
* None of us currently have grades for 491 - Dr. Kothari and Dr. Mina are aware of this issue

### Contributions

* Jesse Olds - 4 hours - Started investigation into Eclipse Plugin development
* Brian Reber - 4 hours - Worked on the website, created new repository for toolbox, explored J-Atlas and Annotations
* Nick Buchholz - 4 hours - Started creating the more extensive testing application
